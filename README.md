Frequently Asked Questions
‚ùì How do I reset my characters?
Clear your browser's localStorage for this site, or use the delete function for individual characters.

‚ùì Can I use this for other RPG systems?
While designed for D&D 5e, the custom options make it adaptable for other systems with similar character structures.

‚ùì Is my data secure?
Yes! All data stays in your browser - nothing is sent to any server.

‚ùì Why can't I export to PDF?
The export function is a placeholder. For now, use your browser's print function (Ctrl+P) to save as PDF.
